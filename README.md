# Let your project be a story, not just a repo!

## Why Zappy ?
> The word "Zappy" conveys a sense of energy and vibrancy, serving as a fitting title that embodies the spirit of adventure, imagination, and fun that defines the Toy Story.

> That's why I wanted Zappy to be more than just a project â€“ I wanted it to be a place where people could have fun and talk about the power of imagination.

> In simple words, creating this project was like reliving my favorite childhood memories, trying to capture all the excitement and fun of Toy Story, and bringing people together to share in that joy.
